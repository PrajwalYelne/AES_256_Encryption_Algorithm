# AES_256_Encryption_Algorithm

In the developing world of the digital media most of the instructions are shared via electronics media . Thus there is a need for protecting those data from malicious attacks. Here cryptography comes into existence . 

Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is implemented in software and hardware throughout the world to encrypt sensitive data. It is essential for computer security, cybersecurity and electronic data protection. It is a method of protecting information and communications using codes, so information can be accessed by those for whom it is intended.

It is generally of 128 bits with varying key lengths. It can be used for both encryption and decryption. In the modern world most of the web browsers uses AES to protect the connection with websites.
